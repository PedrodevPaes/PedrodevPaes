Production Engineering student at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF), with a great interest in technology, web development and improvement in data analysis. I seek to integrate technical engineering knowledge with the programming area to develop practical and efficient solutions to real problems.

I have initial experience with tools and programming languages ​​aimed at web development, and I am constantly improving in data analysis, focusing on understanding how to transform data into strategic information. My goal is to work at the intersection between technology and engineering, contributing to optimizing processes, improving decision-making and driving innovation.

I'm looking for opportunities to apply and expand this knowledge and connect with professionals and companies that share this vision of growth and innovation.
